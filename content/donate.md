If any members of the Perl or Raku communities wish to ask their employers or
other associates if they would be willing to donate to TPRF, please share [our
prospectus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pQJfIW0u-4gKw1o-f18GyyPdT3YlwrUv/view)

Perl is part of the technology stack running many of today’s businesses. Our
donors and sponsors use Perl and Raku to power their businesses. That’s one
reason they contribute back to our community. But there is so much more that
sponsorship can bring to the community.

- TPRF holds [conferences](https://tprc.us) that bring together the Perl and
  Raku community. Speakers give technical talks and the community gets together
  to discuss approaches to solving the latest technical problems.
- TPRF provides [grants](grants.html) directly in support of projects that
  benefit Perl and Raku users.
- TPRF will take new steps to reach out to the community, training new
  programmers in Perl. It will create an online beginner video training course
  and provide beginner training scholarships.
- [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/): This internship program supports
  diversity in free and open source software. TPRF sponsors this both
  financially and by providing the interns with a mentor.
- We provide a [job posting website ](https://jobs.perl.org/)where employers
  can share information about their open positions.
- Support for [CPAN](https://cpan.org/) and [MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/).
- TPRF hosts events across the world to encourage the formation of new local
  groups as well as re-invigorate existing groups.
- Through online efforts and open-source conferences, TPRF will continue to
  advocate Perl and Raku to the world.
