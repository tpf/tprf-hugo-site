At the start of February 2015, during FOSDEM, Larry
Wall announced that the Perl 6 team intends to declare a
6.0 language (defined by a conformance test suite) along
with a conforming implementation by the end of 2015. The
Perl 6 Development Fund was created to aid key Perl 6
developers in achieving this goal, and to fund Perl 6
development beyond the 6.0 language and implementation
release.
In 2020, The Perl Foundation announced closure of the
Perl 6 Development Fund and launch of the Raku
Development Fund. Details of the funding raised so far
and how this has been spent will be published in
[a public accessible location](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wiTISarw1sPfEUKG5hoE0s8ztz4VBXUxB8iiSULGNeg/edit#gid=0)
for the both funds.

Description of Fund
The donations made to this fund will be used for the
development and improvement of the Raku language
specification and implementations. Funds will be
disbursed via grants awarded by The Perl Foundation in
conjunction with well-respected members of the Raku
community. The grants will be awarded to the most
appropriate applicant(s) and managed in association with
the Raku developers.

Applicant Eligibility
Due to the nature of this fund, and its targeted focus,
eligibility to apply has two initial requirements:

The applicant must be a contributor to the Raku
language specification or one of its
implementations.

The application must be endorsed by one or more
people in Raku Steering Council.

### Approval Process

Once an application has been received, and confirmed as
matching the initial requirements, it will be published
on The Perl Foundation blog for a period of community
feedback. If it is required, by the nature of the grant,
feedback may also be requested from key community
members. During this period of feedback applicants may
be asked to provide additional material or to amend
their application before it is put forward for
evaluation.
Final evaluation of any grants will be performed by the
president of The Perl Foundation in consultation with
other members (Executive, Board and Committee); with
members of the Raku development and Raku Steering
Council.

### License and Release

Any code created, modified or submitted during the
period of the grant must be released as open source
under
the Artistic License 2.0. Completed work must be
published in a public version control system. Release
notes should include an acknowledgement that work was funded by The Perl
Foundation’s Raku Development Fund.

Reporting
Successful applicants must provide a monthly report
publicly at The Perl Foundation News site. Missing two
reports in a row without prior notice will result in
immediate suspension of the grant until The Perl
Foundation has determined if the grant will be permitted
to continue.

### Management

Each grant will have at least one manager to
represent Raku developers and one manager to represent
The Perl Foundation. A grant manager may not fill both
roles simultaneously.

Payments will be made on a monthly basis, in arrears,
only after the work has been signed off and the
monthly report has been published to The Perl
Foundation’s blog by the grant manager.

In the case of a dispute that cannot be resolved
the grant will be terminated.

### Termination of Grant

As previously stated, missing two reports in a row
without prior notice will suspend the grant. Payment
will be made for the work completed to date. For
time-based grants, payment will be for hours worked. For
milestone based grants, payment will be made up to the
last completed milestone.

## Management of Fund

### Administration Costs

The administration costs of running the fund, including
the wire transfer fees, will be taken from the
fund.

### Review

The structure of this fund may be amended at the
discretion of the The Perl Foundation Board, in
consultation with the Raku team. Any changes made to the
fund would not apply to grants already running, unless
The Perl Foundation and the grantee agree to such a
change.

### Termination

If a period of one year has elapsed with no grants in
progress and no new applications, the remaining funds
will be transferred to the TPRF general fund.
