Funding leading Perl developers and educators enables the
Perl Foundation to efficiently pursue its mandate to
advance the use and understanding of Perl in the wider
community.

Public presentations by grant recipients offer
grass-roots Perl users unprecedented opportunities to
learn from and interact with leading members of the Perl
community, and also provide an important means for the
those users to direct feedback to the language
developers.

Writing articles for print and on-line media enhances
that transfer of information and adds to the learning
resources available to the community.
The grants recipients have the opportunity to focus their
considerable talents on important projects that can
directly benefit tens of thousands of Perl users around
the world. This may involve improving Perl's own code
base, or developing valuable new software for general use.
Recipients have the time and the freedom-from-distraction
to study difficult problems carefully, and develop
practical, efficient, and easy-to-use- solutions to
them.

The grants themselves have raised the profile of the Open
Source community, promoting debate on the economics of
"free" software, and the funding models that can best be
support non-commercials development. They also engender a
greater sense of community pride in and proprietorship of
the Perl language, acting as a focus around which
interest, energy, and productive interactions can be
built.

## Direct Benefits to Sponsors

### A Vital Perl Language:

Perl has a worldwide impact, and Raku is an important new
generation of efficient, flexible Perl. Individuals and
corporations that depend on, have an interest in, and love
Perl can contribute directly to support the basic costs of
development and support for this great programming
language.

### Tax Deductibility:

TPF is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization with offices
in Holland, Michigan. All donations to TPF are tax
deductible for US residents. Donations may also qualify as
tax deductions by individuals in other countries as well
(check your local regulations). Employers may match
individual donations.

### Kudos:

The Open Source and Free Software movement often operate
as meritocracies, in which reputation reflects
performance. Sponsoring a high-profile, high-achiever from
within these communities is an excellent way to gain
credit and status, both directly for the donation itself
and indirectly be association with the grant
recipient.
The software community is also heavily driven by
personalities, and many members strongly identify with
talented individuals. Visible support for such people is
seen as visible support for the community, and is a rich
source of goodwill.
This funding drive and the subsequent grants will receive
significant publicity throughout the Open Source IT
industry. Historically, donations made early in the
fund-raising process are particularly effective in
garnering community recognition and approval.

### Publicity:

TPF publicity acknowledges all sponsors, and provides
special recognition for large donors.
Sponsors donation US$5,000 or more have the opportunity
to display their corporate logo on the TPF website, with a
link to their home-page and a personalized note of
recognition and thanks from TPF.
Sponsors contributing US$10,000 or more may additionally
set up their own page on the TPF website (with only minor
restrictions on content).
Sponsors donating US$50,000 or more are also granted the
naming rights to a particular grant. For example: "The 202
GoodWillCorp Perl Development Grant".

### Software:

All software developed under a TPF Development grant must
be released under a publicly available license that is
free for redistribution and use without discrimination
against field of endeavor. The fruits of the work are thus
immediately available for use by sponsors. Furthermore,
although sponsors are not entitled to direct the course of
software development, their ideals, suggestions, and
questions naturally received particular attention by grant
recipients.

### Training:

Grant recipients travel widely as part of their grant,
and provide free public seminars on their work wherever
they go. Not surprisingly, their travels itinerary almost
always includes major IT centers where their sponsors are
likely to be situated. For example, in 2001 Dr. Conway
presented seminars in locations accessible to each of his
six sponsors.

Grant recipients also offer major sponsors special
discounted rates on corporate training.
Each grant is budgeted individually, according to the
duration of the award, the recipient's financial needs,
and projected expenses (travel, equipment, etc.) A typical
amount for a 12-month grant involving some domestic US
travel would be US$80,000.

The purpose and goals of each grant are also individually
negotiated with the recipient. These may include and
combination of:

- Development of specific software packages
- Maintenance and enhancement of the Perl core code
- Design or implementation work for the forthcoming Perl 6
- Delivering keynotes, tutorials, and other presentations at national
  and international conferences
- Speaking at local Perl and Open Source user groups,
- Participation in relevant on-line forums
- Any other activity the committee deems beneficial to the wider Perl
  community
