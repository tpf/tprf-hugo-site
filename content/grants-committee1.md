Rules of Operation

1. Grant Proposals Scheduling

Grant proposals will be evaluated every two months. The
evaluation process will take place during January,
March, May, July, September, and November.

An approved grant proposal, which has not been funded
will be considered during the next evaluation, after
which it will no longer be considered. The person
requesting the grant may resubmit the proposal with no
charges if they wish.

Grant proposals which have been rejected must be
written.

If there are no funds available to award any grants,
then the evaluation period will still count regarding
grant expiration.

If the Grants Committee funds are expired, a note will
be published to the community stating that grants
evaluation is stalled. The standard process will resume
when funds are available, and a note will be published
to the community.

2. Grantees, Proposals, and Grant Managers

Each grantee will have a Grant Manager appointed to them
to monitor the progress of the grant. Grant Managers
should report at least every calendar month on progress
and present the grantee's final report when the grant is
completed.

The amount requested, the funds available, and the
relevancy of the proposal will be considered when
evaluating grant proposals.

Grants are paid upon completion, after a full report is
evaluated by the committee, and published to the
community.

Grantees must request an interim payment of up to half
the grant amount during the grant period. Such payments
must be approved by the Grants Committee.

Grantees must provide a monthly report, even if no
progress has been made. This report may be published to
the community.

If the grantee does not report for two consecutive
months, or if no progress is made for four months, the
grant will be considered a failure and will be closed
without further payment.

3. Grants Committee Voting Schema

A grant vote shall not be valid unless at least 2/3 of
the members vote.

Each individual vote shall be a No, a 0 for abstain, or
1 through 5 for a Yes.

The grants which have more Yes votes than No votes shall
be ranked according to the sum of the votes.

Accordingly with the available funds, the Grants
Committee will agree on how many of the
approved proposals to fund.

4. Structure

The Grants Committee assigns a Grant Manager to each
approved and funded grant

Each grant's Grant Manager is responsible for
collecting and posting updates on the grant and for
all other interaction with the grantee

Grant Managers do not need to be the members of the
Committee.

One voting member is the Committee Secretary. The
Secretary represents the Grants Committee in the TPRF
Steering Committee.

The Secretary is nominated and elected by the
Committee and approved by the TPRF board.

The secretary is responsible for managing grant
proposals, votes, and all other administrative
business.

There is no fixed term of the Secretary position.
Its continuation is subject to an annual vote of
confidence by the other Committee members.

The Secretary does not normally cast votes in the
approval process, but will vote if a tie results
from the initial round of voting.

5. Amendments and Exceptions

Changes to these rules must be approved by 2/3 of
the Grants Committee and by the TPRF Board of Directors.

In special circumstances exceptions to these rules may
be made, being approved by 2/3 of the Grants Committee.
