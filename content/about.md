## About The Perl and Raku Foundation (TPRF)

The Perl and Raku Foundation (TPRF) is a U.S.-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the Perl and Raku programming languages through open discussion, collaboration, design, and code. Our mission is to foster a strong, healthy, and sustainable ecosystem and community for both languages, ensuring their ongoing growth, relevance, and accessibility.

### What We Do

- **Grants and Funding:** TPRF provides grants to support the development of Perl and Raku, including core language enhancements, new features, performance improvements, and community-driven projects.
- **Events and Conferences:** The Foundation sponsors and organizes events worldwide, such as the annual [Perl and Raku Conference](https://perlconference.us/), workshops, and hackathons. These gatherings are vital for sharing ideas, fostering collaboration, and building community connections.
- **Community Support:** TPRF promotes and supports local user groups (like Perl Mongers), online communities (such as PerlMonks), and the broader ecosystem by maintaining key infrastructure and resources.
- **Mentorship and Outreach:** Through mentorship programs, outreach initiatives, and participation in efforts like Outreachy, TPRF encourages learning, diversity, and inclusion within the community.
- **Recognition:** The Foundation celebrates outstanding contributions with awards such as the White Camel Award, recognizing those who exemplify the communityâ€™s values and spirit.

### Coordinating Grassroots Efforts

The Foundation also supports the efforts of numerous grass-roots Perl-based groups and organizations. These include [The Perl Conference](https://perlconference.us/), which brings together hundreds of Perl and Raku programmers from around the world for learning, networking, and collaboration.

### Legal Stewardship

We also carry the legal responsibility for key assets and projects in the Perl and Raku ecosystem, including:

- [Perl 5](http://www.perl.org/get.html)
- [Raku](http://dev.perl.org/perl6/)
- [perl.org](http://www.perl.org/)
- [Perl Mongers](http://www.pm.org/)
- [PerlMonks](http://www.perlmonks.org/)

### Governance and Transparency

TPRF operates with a volunteer board of directors, supported by committees focused on grants, conferences, and other operational areas. The board meets monthly, and there are regular community engagement meetings open to all. The Foundation also employs a paid administrator to assist with day-to-day operations and fundraising.

The Foundation is committed to transparency, regularly publishing financial reports and updates on how funds are allocated, particularly for grants and community support.
