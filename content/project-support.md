## TPRF administrative support for Community Projects.

Introduction
The board is here to help our Perl and Raku
communities. Fund management is a complex task that
requires a significant amount of knowledge and overhead.
There are projects throughout the Perl and Raku
communities that collect funds and need convenient
access to use them. We are here to help!

We see this as an excellent way to help out smaller
projects and sub-communities within the greater Perl and
Raku ecosystems that have the need to manage funds but
lack the human resources or infrastructure to do so on
their own.

### Terminology

- "Foundation" or "The Foundation" refers to Yet Another Society
  (YAS), also doing business as The Perl Foundation (TPRF), The Raku
  Foundation (TRF) and The Perl & Raku Foundation (TPRF).
- "Board" refers to the duly appointed Board of Directors of Yet
  Another Society.

### What the Foundation will provide

The primary benefit will be a fund designated for use
only with the project. Donors to this fund will benefit
from the Foundation’s 501(c)(3) status. This potentially
provides, among other things, tax benefits to companies
donating money to participating funds.

Your project will be listed as supported by the
Foundation on our website.

A donation link will be provided on our website for
your fund.

### How the fund works

Funds are contributed to the Foundation with the
intended project specified as part of the donation.
These funds are then available for use in the
project.

Only officers may direct fund usage. All officers
should concur on expenses. Directing funds will be done
in the form of email communication involving the
treasurer and all officers. A lack of response by an
officer is presumed to be agreement after 3 days.

There may be uses of the fund that are disallowed by
our legal status. For example, no money can be sent or
received from countries or people on the US OFAC list.
The Foundation may have rules or resolutions preventing
payment as well (for example, if a sanction was issued
against someone found to violate the Foundation’s bylaws
or code of conduct). Such issues would be discussed with
the fund managers when they occur.

Donors may not direct the usage of donated funds. Once
money is made available to the fund, it can be used by
the officers as they see fit.

### How can officers be changed

Occasionally the leadership of a project may change and
the officers of the fund may need to change
accordingly.

To make this change, a majority of the current leaders
must communicate to the Board a request for change in
writing. The Board shall consider the request and will
attempt to consult with all leaders to confirm their
wishes. Should a leader be non-responsive after a
reasonable amount of time (at least a couple of weeks),
it will be assumed they agree with the proposed
change.

### Project Sunset

Termination of the fund may happen for the following
reasons.

The project fails to keep and maintains an approved
Code of Conduct. This will be determined by
board.

No financial activity for a 2 year period.

Active officers vote to disband the fund.

When the fund is closed, all money will then be
transferred to the general board fund for use by the
Board at their discretion.

### How to Request Creation of a Fund

Interested communities/projects would apply to the
Foundation through the following
[Google](https://forms.gle/HLr5ByRLhmR5etNa8)[form](https://forms.gle/HLr5ByRLhmR5etNa8).
As part of the application, the participating project
shall provide proof of having a suitable Code of Conduct
and commit to also following any Code of Conduct the
Foundation adopts, as well as the judgments issued by
the Foundation.

### Requirements

For the Foundation to support a project, we require the
project to present a petition to the board specifying
the following details.

How will your group be identified?

2 (3 is preferred) or more principal officers for
the group. (Who can direct funds?)

A charter for the group which includes:

Intended use cases for the fund (grants?
hardware? services? workshops?)

Criteria and guidance for applications, along
with likely acceptance criteria

Directions on how to contact the officers and
apply for funds

How much funds do you have now?

How much funds do you expect to receive
yearly?

The project must specify or adopt a Code of Conduct
(“COC”) acceptable to the TPRF board. Criteria for
acceptance of this Code will include (but are not
limited to):

The code of conduct includes protection for the
members ( both established and future members)
of your group.

Scope of enforcement (what forums/spaces are
covered by this code?)

We will consider any possible history of
enforcement (or lack thereof).

This COC must not be any less permissive than
the Foundation’s COC, and in the event the
Foundation’s COC becomes less permissive, the
project’s COC must be updated as well.

### What happens after you are approved

A fund or sub-fund will be established in the name of
the project by the Foundation.
Funds are transferred by the participating project to
the Foundation. One or more representatives will be
appointed by the project and recognized by the
Foundation as authorized to direct spending from this
fund. The process by which funds are authorized by the
project are to be determined by each project
independently.

- Your project will be listed as supported by the Foundation on our website.
- A donation link will be provided on our website for your fund.
