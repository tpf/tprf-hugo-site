- Entering into any contract or agreement worth more than \$5,000.

The Committee shall be restricted to only those activities

time.

establishment. The rules shall be attached to this charter
as “Exhibit A, Committee Operating Rules”. The rules shall
be subject to review annually, being reaffirmed as part of
the business of the annual meeting required herein. The
rules shall be amended according to the procedure set forth
in Exhibit A at other times, when, in the judgement of the
chair, such amendments are needed to support the effective
operation of the Committee.
