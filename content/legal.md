The Perl Foundation is a legally registered DBA (Doing
Business As) name of Yet Another Society. The foundation
incorporated as Yet Another Society, so that's the name
you'll see in the earlier documents. We now use the name
The Perl Foundation, because it does a better job of
explaining what we do.

The top level of TPRF is the board of directors.
It holds the ultimate authority in the organization, but in
practice only exercises veto power. The board is
self-electing, and usually draws its candidates from the
pool of TPRF volunteers.

The active members of the
board are the president, who oversees the daily work of TPRF,
and the treasurer, who acts as a final sanity check on all
expenses. These positions are elected by the board. Each
president is free to choose their focus for activity: the
first president concentrated on conferences and on
incorporating TPRF as a non-profit foundation; the current
president concentrates on general Perl legal issues and on
building TPRF's relations with companies and other open
source foundations.

The next level is the
Steering Committee (SC), which handles the real work of TPRF.
The committee is chartered with the full power of the board,
aside from a few financial restrictions (they need board
approval to spend huge gobs of cash or put the foundation
into debt). The SC is a self-electing group of volunteers.
The positions on the SC are loosely defined around areas of
work: Grants, Conferences, Awards, PR, Donor relations,
Perl.org and PerlFoundation.org websites, Perl Mongers,
CPAN, etc.

The Grants Committee (GC) reviews
grant proposals, allocates grant funding, and oversees the
grants as they're completed. This committee is self-electing
and made up of active Perl developers (with a heavy
concentration of pumpkings), because they have the best
sense of what grants will help Perl.
The Conferences
Committee oversees YAPC::NA and offers assistance to the
other YAPC conferences and Perl workshops around the world.
This committee is self-electing and largely made up of
organizers from previous YAPC's.

The majority of
TPRF's work is done by volunteers, and all it takes to become
a volunteer is to do the job you're volunteering for and
talk to the relevant committee. It's a meritocracy, so we're
more concerned with what people do than with titles, but if
you do the work you'll get the title. Every year each
committee reviews the current positions, some people step
down, others volunteer to take their places, and others
trade places. 1-3 years is really about enough for anyone to
stay in one volunteer position, otherwise people tend to
burn out.

This structure may seem strange at
first, but it mirrors the way Perl development has
structured itself over the years. At the top, the community
recognizes Larry as the ultimate authority on what Perl
should be, but he rarely exercises that authority. The
pumpkings are the next level; they make the day-to-day
decisions on where Perl should go and make releases. Below
that are the people with commit access to the repositories
who filter and apply patches and changes. And beyond that
are the general community contributors who submit patches
and participate in the mailing lists. Anyone can move from
contributor to commit access to pumpking. It's a
self-selecting meritocracy: each pumpking selects their
successor, and the group with commit access chooses who
should get commit access. The people who do the work get
invited to step up.
