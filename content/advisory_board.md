## TPRF Advisory Board

The TPRF Advisory Board is for people who want to be connected to The Perl Foundation in a non-executive and non-operational capacity, providing the Board access to wider knowledge and experience, and seek support where needed.

Members are invited by the board and may include retired board members or specific key members of the wider community.

## What is the role of the Advisory Board?

The role of the Advisory Board is to support TPRF Board in a non-voting capacity. The aim is to have access to tacit knowledge and experience. Apart from general dialogue between the members, TPRF Board and communities only expect occasional support from the Advisory Board.

## Who can sit on the Advisory Board?

Members of the Advisory Board are selected by TPRF Board. Those invited to join include former Board or Committee members, and in some cases, external people.

Current members of the Board may also participate in the Advisory Board communications.

## How are members invited?

Invitation letters are sent electronically by TPRF President. There is no automatic membership of the Advisory Board. It is strictly by invitation only.

## How does one leave the Advisory Board?

A member can give notice at any time or may be asked to leave by the sitting TPRF president.

## How do members communicate?

A low-volume mailing list is set up for members to communicate with each other and between TPRF Board liaison and the Advisory Board.

## Who is Chair of the Advisory Board?

The position of Chair and liaison with TPRF Board is held by the sitting TPRF president or a nominated Board memebr who will keep the communications open.

## What is expected of a member of the Advisory Board?

Advisory Board members will:

- provide help and assistance to our organization where possible for future and historical issues
- Join occasional board meetings when requested, no more than twice per year
- be expected to be exemplars of professional behavior and role models for our community
