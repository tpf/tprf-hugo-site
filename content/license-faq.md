### Why has TPRF adopted a CLA process?

We
all know that code needs to be documented with a certain
amount of care and accuracy. Good documentation benefits
both programmers and users. The legal relationships between
contributors, users, and TPRF need to be documented for
similar reasons: long-term project stability, meeting the
needs of open source users for adequate and effective legal
documentation, and reducing the risk of disruptive legal
disputes and intellectual property claims.
Also, in the
years since the first release of Perl software, open source
as a means for distributing and developing technology has
grown and changed. There are many more people and
organizations involved, as users and as contributors. The
success of the open source model has exposed leading open
source programs and organizations to potential threats from
organizations opposed to the increasing influence of this
way of making and distributing code.
The global open
source community is recognizing that using intellectual
property and licensing tools to protect and preserve the
openness of open source is essential. Licenses and other
legal tools, like copyrights and trademarks, which were used
to build closed proprietary technologies, are now being
re-purposed to keep open source code freely available.

### Do companies who want to contribute material created by their employees need to use a special CLA form?

No. However, in addition to signing the CLA on its
own behalf, a contributing company (or other organization)
should have each contributing employee sign a CLA, in case
an employee's contribution turns out to be owned by the
contributing employee, rather than the employer. This could
occur if, under local laws, or due to problems with the
company's internal intellectual property policies, some
elements of the contribution are owned by the employee. Laws
on employer ownership of employees' work product vary from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

### As an employee, do I need to have my employer sign a CLA for my contribution?

No. However, if your employer does own intellectual
property rights in your work, having your employer sign a
CLA is a good way to confirm that you and your employer
share a common understanding of your contribution. Under the
CLA, the contributor represents that if his or her employer
has intellectual property rights in the contribution, the
contributor has cleared those rights either by having the
employer sign a CLA, or getting permission, or a waiver of
the employer's rights, in order to make the contribution.

### Do I have to list any, or all, of my prior contributions? That could be impossible.

You are not required to list any of your prior
contributions. However, as part of the TPRF process for
documenting contribution licenses, we may ask you to list
key prior contributions. You are also free to specify them
on the schedule on your own, if you would like to do so.

### Why are patents treated separately from other intellectual property?

Patents are treated separately because the legal
rules for patents are significantly different from the rules
for other kinds of intellectual property. One goal of the
patent clause is to reduce the likelihood of patent
infringement claims by terminating the license to use TPRF
code of anyone who asserts that TPRF code infringes a patent.
