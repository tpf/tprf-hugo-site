The work of The Perl & Raku Foundation includes making sure that Perl & Raku
code and documentation are free and open for all to use, and remain free and
open for all to use. One of the many ways we do this is through Perl & Raku
trademarks. The Perl & Raku trademarks are tools we can use to identify Perl &
Raku code, documentation, projects, and other material originating with Perl &
Raku, or licensees who agree to and follow certain requirements.

But our responsibility is also partly the responsibility of the Perl & Raku
communities.

By helping us protect the Perl & Raku trademarks, you help us protect the
openness and integrity of the Perl & Raku languages.

These guidelines are intended to cover general situations, in a general way.

Sometimes TPRF may have different or additional requirements for specific
situations.

## User Logos

Any individual, organization, or company may use the
"Powered by Perl" or "Programming Republic of Perl" logos
to show support for Perl or as part of a notice to users
that your product or website runs on Perl. On websites,
these logos should always link to [http://www.perl.org](http://www.perl.org/). These logos may not be used on product packaging or to
promote products and services, or to create the impression
of an endorsement or certification by TPRF.

## Perl Marks for Use by TPRF Organizations

The Perl logo, the Perl Foundation logo, and the bare
onion logo are available for use by Perl Mongers,
PerlMonks, and Perl.org, which are part of TPRF.

These Perl marks are available for use on their websites and materials
promoting Perl, TPRF, and their projects (on t-shirts, mugs, flyers, etc.).

This
authorization to use the Perl logo is limited to uses by
the organizations themselves, and doesn't extend to
individual members.

Representatives of the
organizations should contact us at [trademark@perlfoundation.org](mailto:trademark@perlfoundation.org) to obtain high-resolution versions of the Perl
logo, and answers to any questions they have about use of
the logo.

## Use of Perl Marks by YAPC

The affiliated YAPC conferences around the world may use
the Perl logo on their websites or materials promoting the
conferences with prior written permission from TPRF.
Contact [trademark@perlfoundation.org](mailto:trademark@perlfoundation.org) for permission, and once permission is granted, for
high-resolution versions of the Perl logo.

## Perl Marks Available for Perl Redistributors

Licensed redistributors of Perl code are permitted by
their licenses to use the Perl logo in connection with
their distribution services, on product packaging, and in
promotional materials. Contact [trademark@perlfoundation.org](mailto:trademark@perlfoundation.org) for more information on becoming a licensed Perl
redistributor.

## Other Uses

For any other uses, contact us at [trademark@perlfoundation.org](mailto:trademark@perlfoundation.org) to discuss your proposal.

## Use Guidelines

Anyone who uses any Perl mark is required to comply with
these use guidelines, as well as the requirements in your
license, if you are a licensee. For special or unusual
projects, we may ask you to comply with requirements
specific to your use.

Marks must always be legible and clearly reproduced.

Do not incorporate any Perl marks into the marks, logos,
or name of your business, project, or organization,
unless you have the prior written permission of TPRF.

Marks must be used in their entirety. Any variation in
the form of the mark must be approved in advance in
writing by TPRF. A trademark symbol should follow all
prominent uses of the marks. Certain types of projects,
products and packaging may require additional notices.
Please contact us for more information and to discuss
your intended use. Use the trademark symbol as shown
below.

A notice which identifies TPRF as the mark's owner must
also be used. For example: "The Perl logo is a trademark
of the Perl Foundation."

## Onions and the Perl Trademark

People sometimes ask if TPRF's use of an onion in the Perl
logo means that independent projects that use or relate to
Perl need TPRF's permission to use an onion of their own
design in connection with their project.

The
answer is "not necessarily" as long as no likelihood of
confusion is created. One of the fundamental legal bases for
trademark protection is to make sure that the public can
depend on a mark as an accurate indicator of a particular
source or relationship, and one way of defining trademark
infringement is to say that the infringing mark creates a
likelihood of confusion. Likelihood of confusion is
determined based not only on making a comparison of the
marks side-by-side, but also on making a comparison of the
contexts in which they are actually used. Thus, it's easy to
imagine independent onions that would be fine, and
independent onions that might not be. Contact us at [trademark@perlfoundation.org](mailto:trademark@perlfoundation.org) if you have any questions, or would like us to
evaluate a particular logo or usage to see if it would be an
infringement.

## Playing your Part

The Perl marks provide a valuable service to the Perl
community and the public at large, and we are counting on
you to share with us the responsibility of protecting
their integrity. Thanks for your help.
