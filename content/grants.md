Funding projects within the greater Perl and Raku
communities enables developers, educators, and The Perl
Foundation to advance the use and understanding of Perl and
Raku in the wider software development community.

Grant
recipients have the opportunity to focus their considerable
talents on important projects that can directly benefit tens
of thousands of Perl and Raku users around the world. Grants
may cover a variety of ground, from core language
improvements to documentation and tutorials.

### About the Committee

The Grants Committee was formed in 2003 to oversee
the allocation of grant funding within The Perl Foundation.
The individuals chosen to be committee members represent a
wide range of positions and talents within the Perl and Raku
communities (from core Perl and Raku developers to CPAN
module developers, and everything in between).

While
grant requests can be submitted at any time, the Committee
opens a call for grant proposals every two months. During
this two week window, grant requests are posted for public
feedback and refined before they are evaluated by the Grants
Committee. The committee members then review and vote on any
proposals. Grants that are approved are funded by TPF, and
assigned a manager for the duration of the grant to act as a
liaison between the grantee and TPF. This manager is usually
a member of the Grants Committee.

For a current
list of members, see the
[Who's Who](committees.html) page.

The
Grants Committee is an important interface between TPF, the
Perl and Raku communities, and the companies and developers
that use these languages in their software and processes. As
the grants bring about enhancements to the languages and
their ecosystems,
[those companies who provide sponsorship](our-donors.html) also gain satisfaction that they have directly
contributed to the improvement of the Perl and Raku
languages (while reaping the tax benefits of their
donation).
